# my_app

**This is for personal use, so I don't recommend using it. It is not documented and it is subject to change.**

To open the documentation, run the following VSCode Task (`CMD+SHIFT+B`):

```sh
[Project] Documentation (Serve)
```

This will open the documentation at [localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000).

However, if this is your first time opening the documentation, you will need to run the following commands to install [mkdocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) and the [material theme](https://github.com/squidfunk/mkdocs-material).

```sh
pip install mkdocs
```

```sh
pip install mkdocs-material
```
